# Simple Workout App

This app is meant for me, but I want to share it. The goal is to have an app that simply helps create workouts and tracks progress with them. This is a "no thrills" app that should simply do the thing. In terms of strength training, I only care about setting up the workouts for certain days of the week or whatever is in season for me, setting the exercise, sets, reps, and rest time, then logging the progress over time for sets, reps, and weight used. I'm sure it could be useful for other kinds of workouts though. This has no fancy bells and whistles. Just should do what it says it does which is hopefully "simple". And hopefully after it is all "done", it can stay that way üòÅ.
